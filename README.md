Hello, my name is Davi. I am 18 years old and I enjoy studying technology, currently focusing on web software development. At the moment, I am studying Python, FastAPI, and Git, along with other tools and best practices that I consider essential to becoming a good developer. I am also interested in Linux and am currently exploring Arch Linux, although I have used other distributions before.

In addition to programming and technology in general, I strive to develop myself in other areas, studying languages such as English and French.
